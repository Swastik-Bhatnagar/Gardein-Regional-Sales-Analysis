# Gardein-s-Regional-Sales-Analysis
Led a comprehensive data analytics project to optimize unit and dollar sales for Gardein, a leading plant-based food brand. Using Python for data analysis and regression modeling, I analyzed 824,000+ data points to identify key drivers of sales performance across different product categories and U.S. regions. Developed a robust predictive model (RÂ² = 0.709) that revealed significant insights: Burger products showed the highest sales impact (coefficient: 394.27), with Great Lakes region leading performance (+3109.61 units). The analysis uncovered regional preferences - Northeast excelling in poultry/seafood substitutes, while Plains and South-Central regions showed growth opportunities. Created data-driven recommendations for targeted marketing strategies, optimal product positioning, and regional expansion plans that could significantly boost Gardein's market penetration in the competitive plant-based food industry.
